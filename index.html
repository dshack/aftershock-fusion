						<p><a href="http://www.reverbnation.com/davidkeogh">David Keogh</a> performs and DJ’s at social dance festivals and exchanges around the country. His music features downtempo beats layered over lush piano, violin and electronics, with an emphasis on rhythm, tempo and musicality for that magical blend of dance-forms we call fusion. David is a fusion and alt-blues veteran, performing at five different Fusion Exchanges, both Atomic Blues Fusion events, and numerous others around the country.</p>

						<p><a href="http://worldofmrmoo.com">Mr. Moo</a> grew up surrounded by nature, music, and 6-7 months of rainy, overcast days. Luckily, music is a wonderful distraction against the gloom and he has spent the past few years honing his production skills, building upon his classical violin training to create something new. His music is a particular blend of lyrical old-school classical violin, gypsy fiddle and infectious break-beats. A MrMoo performance pulls heavily on sounds from all over the world, samples of music from different cultures and time-periods, all glued together live….on the spot… to take you into another world.</p>

						<img src="images/adin.jpg" class="profile-pic"></img>
						<p>Adin Van Duyne has been playing music since his first piano lesson at age 8. His instrument ADD lead him to play clarinet, oboe, guitar, and all sorts of percussion by the time he was in high school. Recently he's been learning harmonica and banjo. Dancing brought his passion for music full circle and provided him with an opportunity to perform as a musician. Using a phrase sampler, Adin performs solo without any pre recorded music. Everything you hear is created live on the spot thanks to some awesome technology and fancy footwork.</p>

						<p>With over 15 years of dance experience including Irish Folk Dancing, Victorian Ballroom, Lindy Hop, Tango, Blues and Contact Improv, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/djTRTL">A’lan Abruzzo</a> has found a home in the fusion world. He strongly believes that amazing dancing is a blend of learning the fundamentals of dance technique and creating a powerful connection. His enthusiasm for the sensual, the passionate and the experiential fuels his deep exploration into the music that moves dancers, physically and emotionally. When he DJs, he takes us on a journey into the body, the soul, the spirit and, most importantly, the joy of being human.

						<p>Mark Carpenter started 'spinning' in 2007 and has since played in a dozen States and four countries. Once a SLO native, he has been traveling the USA (and world) since 2010, playing wherever he can. He plays only the most quality songs from his eclectic musical collection and has stolen unapologetically from every great dj, musician or music aficionado he's encountered. His musical offerings range from gut-wrenching blues soul-lifting jazz to jaw-dropping dubstep. Get excited.</p>

					<div class="col-md-3 col-sm-3">
						<img src="images/kermit.jpg" class="profile-pic"></img>
						<p>Kermit grew up in St. Louis, Missouri, where dancing to live blues was just called "dancing."  He has been dancing the form we now call "blues dancing" since the early days of the blues dance revival in the house parties up and down the west coast.  It is the organic, conspiratorial, personally-expressive spirit of those parties he channels in his musical style.  He coined the term "Turquoise" to take away linguistic ammunition from those who like to argue that there is correct and incorrect music to dance to.  His music is intended first, and last, for dancers. Kermit is a regular DJ at Shades of Blues in San Francisco.  He has DJ'ed at national events Off Grid Blues and (Alt) Blues Recess events.</p>

						<img src="images/kelly.jpg" class="profile-pic"></img>
						<p>Kelly Howard loves to DJ almost as much as she loves to dance. She began her DJ career in Seattle around 2007 at house parties. Since 2009, she has DJ'ed at blues and fusion venues in the Pacific Northwest. She began traveling in 2012 and DJ'ed at various dance events along the west coast. Primarily an electronica DJ, she combines a wide array of emotions and flavors: angst & grit, passion and despair. She loves creating a challenging atmosphere that keeps dancers breathless and wanting more. Some of her all-time favorite artists are Stateless, Beats Antique, Glitch Mob, and Lynx & Janover.</p>

						<p>Angie Huang was a music aficionado long before she started dancing. She began DJing and dancing lindy hop in 2009 at a college club, later expanding her love of music with her love of dance. She started by regularly DJing at The Firehouse 5 in Sacramento and has since played at Mission:Fusion, Blue Rose, Lost Valley Blues Recess, Shades of Blues, and a good number of house parties. As a DJ, she caters to the night by reading the floor well and giving dancers what they want, gauging and adjusting for the energy and mood in the room. Her music choices can include jazz, blues and the blues-inspired, funk, rock, soul, lyrical, all kinds of acoustic, and varied electronic. She loves DJing as much as she loves dancing, and there’s such satisfaction in playing for happy dancers!</p>
