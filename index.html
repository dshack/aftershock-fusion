						<p><a href="http://dshack.net">David Shackelford</a> has been dancing since 2008, teaching and DJing since 2010, and is a five-year veteran of the Fusion Exchange team. David likes yummy covers, helping students discover musicality, and remembering that dance is supposed to be fun.

						<p>Nicole Trissell picked up blues and Fusion dancing five years ago and quickly jumped in as a dancer, DJ and teacher who travels the country in search of her next dance adventure. She has helped run a number of dance venues in her native New Mexico, and was a founding member of Atomic Blues Fusion and on the organizing team all three years it ran. Sheâ€™s excited to now be based in the Bay Area.</p>

					<div class="col-sm-4">
						<img src="images/hugh.jpg" class="profile-pic"></img><p>Hugh Wimberly, another New Mexico native, started dancing just a few months before the first Atomic Blues Fusion, but became so enamored with dancing that he helped organize the next two years. He moved to the Bay Area partially for a programming job, but mostly to be closer to the dance community here he loves so much. He loves DJing and travels as much as he can to dance all over the country.</p>
