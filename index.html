						<p><a href="http://www.reverbnation.com/davidkeogh">David Keogh</a> performs and DJ’s at social dance festivals and exchanges around the country. His music features downtempo beats layered over lush piano, violin and electronics, with an emphasis on rhythm, tempo and musicality for that magical blend of dance-forms we call fusion. David is a fusion and alt-blues veteran, performing at five different Fusion Exchanges, both Atomic Blues Fusion events, and numerous others around the country.</p>

						<p><a href="http://worldofmrmoo.com">Mr. Moo</a> grew up surrounded by nature, music, and 6-7 months of rainy, overcast days. Luckily, music is a wonderful distraction against the gloom and he has spent the past few years honing his production skills, building upon his classical violin training to create something new. His music is a particular blend of lyrical old-school classical violin, gypsy fiddle and infectious break-beats. A MrMoo performance pulls heavily on sounds from all over the world, samples of music from different cultures and time-periods, all glued together live….on the spot… to take you into another world.

						<img src="images/mark.jpg" class="profile-pic"></img>
						<p>Mark Carpenter started 'spinning' in 2007 and has since played in a dozen States and four countries. Once a SLO native, he has been traveling the USA (and world) since 2010, playing wherever he can. He plays only the most quality songs from his eclectic musical collection and has stolen unapologetically from every great dj, musician or music aficionado he's encountered. His musical offerings range from gut-wrenching blues soul-lifting jazz to jaw-dropping dubstep. Get excited.</p>

						<p>Kelly Howard loves to DJ almost as much as she loves to dance. She began her DJ career in Seattle around 2007 at house parties. Since 2009, she has DJ'ed at blues and fusion venues in the Pacific Northwest. She began traveling in 2012 and DJ'ed at various dance events along the west coast. Primarily an electronica DJ, she combines a wide array of emotions and flavors: angst & grit, passion and despair. She loves creating a challenging atmosphere that keeps dancers breathless and wanting more. Some of her all-time favorite artists are Stateless, Beats Antique, Glitch Mob, and Lynx & Janover.</p>

						<p>Angie Huang was a music aficionado long before she started dancing. She began DJing and dancing lindy hop in 2009 at a college club, later expanding her love of music with her love of dance. She started by regularly DJing at The Firehouse 5 in Sacramento and has since played at Mission:Fusion, Blue Rose, Lost Valley Blues Recess, Shades of Blues, and a good number of house parties. As a DJ, she caters to the night by reading the floor well and giving dancers what they want, gauging and adjusting for the energy and mood in the room. Her music choices can include jazz, blues and the blues-inspired, funk, rock, soul, lyrical, all kinds of acoustic, and varied electronic. She loves DJing as much as she loves dancing, and there’s such satisfaction in playing for happy dancers!</p>

							<p>Nicole Trissell picked up blues and Fusion dancing five years ago and quickly jumped in as a dancer, DJ and teacher who travels the country in search of her next dance adventure. She has helped run a number of dance venues in her native New Mexico, and was a founding member of Atomic Blues Fusion and on the organizing team all three years it ran. She’s excited to now be based in the Bay Area.</p>

						<div class="col-sm-4 col-md-4">
							<img src="images/hugh.jpg" class="profile-pic"></img><p>Hugh Wimberly, another New Mexico native, started dancing just a few months before the first Atomic Blues Fusion, but became so enamored with dancing that he helped organize the next two years. He moved to the Bay Area partially for a programming job, but mostly to be closer to the dance community here he loves so much. He loves DJing and travels as much as he can to dance all over the country.</p>
